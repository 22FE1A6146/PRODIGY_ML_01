# PRODIGY_ML_01
# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using a linear regression model built with Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on the following features:
- **Square Footage**
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**

We use a linear regression model to understand the relationship between these features and house prices. The project consists of separate training and testing datasets for training the model and evaluating its performance.

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:
